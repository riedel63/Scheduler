* Version 2.5  7/30/2022


## IDE
* NetBeans 11.0
* Java SE 12.02.2 + 10
* JavaFX-SDK-17.01.1


## Running Application
* To run the packaged application outside NetBeans IDE, go to the dist subdirectory of the application project directory and do the following:

- To run the application in standalone mode, double-click the JAR file.

- To run as a Web Start application, either click the link in the HTML page in your browser or double-click the JNLP file. 
  The advantage of using the link in the browser is that the web page contains logic that uses the Deployment Toolkit, which 
  checks to ensure that the minimum required version of both the Java and JavaFX Runtimes are installed on the user's system.

- To run the application in a web page, open the HTML file in a browser. Note: If you open the HTML file in Google Chrome, you might
  have to click either Run this time or Always run on this site to enable the Java plug-in, as shown in Figure 6-3. Then reload the
  page to run the application.
